# What is OOPS?

**OOPS (Object-Oriented Programming System)** is a programming paradigm that organizes code using **objects and classes** to improve **reusability, modularity, and maintainability**.

In Java, OOPS helps developers build scalable and maintainable applications by modeling real-world entities.

## 🔑 Six Main Pillars of OOPS

### 1️⃣ Class
A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects.  
**Example:** `Car`, `Person`

---

### 2️⃣ Object
An **object** is an instance of a class.  
**Example:** `myCar`, `john`

---

### 3️⃣ Inheritance
**Inheritance** allows a class to acquire properties and behavior from another class.

---

### 4️⃣ Polymorphism
**Polymorphism** allows methods to have the same name but different behavior.
- Method Overloading
- Method Overriding

---

### 5️⃣ Abstraction
**Abstraction** hides complex implementation details and shows only essential features.

---

### 6️⃣ Encapsulation
**Encapsulation** hides data using **private variables** and **public methods** to protect data.
